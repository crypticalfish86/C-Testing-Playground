Hello and welcome to the C Testing Playground,

I have recently started studying C and this Repository is a general area for all small scale C based projects 
I want to try out in order to better understand C as a language. 
Below are the list of projects currently completed or being worked on in this repository as well as a
brief description of their functionality:

1.Y_N_Text_Chat:

    This is a short interactive text chat and my first attempt at programming using a 3 dimensional matrix as well as my first time
    attempting to make an interactive console based program.


2.Decrypt_me:

    This is a short attempt to decrypt a file in C using a txt file in the form of the phonetic alphabet, the file has a deceptively simple syntax 
    but is actually multilayered and posed unique challenges the futher I worked on the problem. This was also my first attempt
    in trying to read a seperate file in C and modify its contents, the file had to be decrypted a total of 6 times, if you want to begin decrypting from decryptMe.txt simply change the output'num'.txt on line 31 and line 40 (beggining with the decryptMe.txt on line 31 and output1.txt on line 40)

Thankyou for visiting my repository ^^,
