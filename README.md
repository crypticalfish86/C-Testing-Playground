Hello and welcome to the C Testing Playground,

I have recently started studying C and this Repository is a general area for all small scale C based projects 
I want to try out in order to better understand C as a language. 
Below are the list of projects currently completed or being worked on in this repository as well as a
brief description of their functionality:

1.Y_N_Text_Chat:

    This is a short interactive text chat and my first attempt at programming using a 3 dimensional matrix as well as my first time
    attempting to make an interactive console based program.


2.Decrypt_me:
    This is a short attempt to decrypt a file in C using a txt file in the form of the phonetic alphabet, this was my first attempt
    in trying to read a seperate file in C and modify its contents

Thankyou for visiting my repository ^^,
