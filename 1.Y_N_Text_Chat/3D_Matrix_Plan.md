a 3 dimensional matrix of this size: 
Z: 3
Y: 3
X: 5

Hitting "x" will change the [Z] coordinate, Hitting "n" will change the [Y] coordinate, Hitting "y" or "Enter" will change the [X] coordinate

so first coordinate is [0][0][0]
last coordinate is [2][2][4]

[
    [[000,001,002,003,004], [010,011,012,013,014], [020,021,022,023,024]],
    [[100,101,102,103,104], [110,111,112,113,114], [120,121,122,123,124]],
    [[200,201,202,203,204], [210,211,212,213,214], [220,221,222,223,224]]
]

Each coordinate will be a string with a max char count of 620 char (hypothetically this array should therefore have a size of roughly 28KB in memory)
